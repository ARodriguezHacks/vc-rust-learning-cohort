## Submitting an Additional Resource

Follow these simple steps to submit another Rust resource to the [Additional Resources](./learning-resources/additional/README.md) list. All pull requests will undergo a review for content applicability and formatting.

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub profile and open it in an IDE of your choosing.
2. Create a new branch beginning with `add-resource`. You can leave it at that or add more to the branch name.
3. Make a copy of [`resource_template.md`](./learning-resources/additional/resource_template.md), keeping it nested in `learning-resources/additional/`, and use this as your starting file when adding a new resource. Look at other resource files to get an idea of how they're supposed to be formatted.
4. List and link the new resource in the [`learning-resources/additional/README.md`](./learning-resources/additional/README.md) file.
5. Commit your work and push it to your remote repo.
6. Create a pull request against the upstream repository.
