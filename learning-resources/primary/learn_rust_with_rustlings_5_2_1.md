The creator of the video suggests two methods of approach to using this resource:

1. Read and attempt the question on your own first. Use the video segments to fill in gaps in your understanding. Then, return to the question to finish the exercise.
2. Watch the video in its entirety. Read and attempt the exercises, revisiting the appropriate video segments whenever you feel stuck.
