# VC Rust Learning Cohort Curriculum

Hello everyone! See below for Virtual Coffee's Rust Learning Cohort Curriculum.

Questions? [Comment on the designated question thread](https://github.com/orgs/Virtual-Coffee/discussions/1122#discussioncomment-8348207) in our VC Discussion Board. We will be posting weekly check-ins on the [#learning-together Slack channel](https://virtual-coffee-group.slack.com/archives/C029MJ4E327) and schedule at least two group review sessions throughout the cohort.

## Usage

Fork this repository to make the VC Rust Learning Cohort your own!

- Adjust the pace of the schedule to suit your needs
- Track your own progress through the curriculum by checking off reading, code, and video tasks as you finish them
- Keep a list of cohort learning materials at hand
- Plus, more resources as the repo is updated

## Curriculum

Check out the curriculum directory for a chapter-by-chapter breakdown. Use the direct links in the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) above for easier navigation.

## Learning Resources

Look in the [Primary](./learning_resources/primary/README.md) directory for materials needed to complete this curriculum. The [Supplementary](./learning_resources/supplementary/README.md) directory contains learning materials that will help you complete the curriculum, but are optional. The [Additional](./learning_resources/additional/README.md) directory houses a general collection of Rust learning resources.

## Suggested Schedule

We have created two suggested schedules to follow, depending on the amount of time you have to commit to learning Rust every week. These schedules will likely be adjusted as we progress through the curriculum and discover how long certain tasks take to complete in real time. Our scheduled tracks are as follows:

- [Tortoise Track](./schedules/tortoise_track.md) üê¢ ‚ûû Plan to commit 1-2 hours per week
- [Hare Track](./schedules/hare_track.md) üêá ‚ûû Plan to commit 2-4 hours per week
